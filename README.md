HackAri is a HackBar clone for Safari. 

The following functionality is implemented:

* **Load URL**: Loads the URL of the current tab, includes loading the POST data if the POST panel is visible.
* **Execute**: Do the request (Can also be done with ctrl-x)
* **URL Encode/Decode**
* **Base64 Encode/Decode**
* **Show/Hide**: Toggles the panels
* **Increment/Decrement**: Only in numbers
* **Make Image**: Renders the page as an image and opens it in a new tab (usefull for screenshots)

The toolbar items can be customized by right-clicking in the toolbar and selecting customize toolbar.

This is not in any way a replacement of HackBar and Firefox. Do use them instead of HackAri and Safari.
